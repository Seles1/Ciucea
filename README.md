This is an old passion project I developed a few years ago. It is a simple game featuring hardcoded levels, specifically designed to teach elementary mathematics to children with learning disabilities.
(Most likely a mess of code, but its my very first project. Also has both a windows and an android version that may or may not be present in this particular git :( )
